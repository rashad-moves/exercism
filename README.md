## What is Exercism?
Exercism is a community driven platform where users can gain proficiency in a wide variety of programming languages by solving problems in a given language's track. Then, users can request mentoring to fine tune their understanding of the respective language. For more experienced programmers of a given language, Exercism is a great place to give back and mentor others.
